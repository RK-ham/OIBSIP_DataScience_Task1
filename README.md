## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

Built a classification model to identify iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.

### What I Did
- Loaded the dataset (Iris.csv)
- Separated features and target column
- Used Decision Tree Classifier to train the model
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Evaluated the performance using accuracy score

### Libraries Used
- pandas  
- sklearn (DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

---

## Objective
To develop a machine learning model that learns from flower measurement data and classifies the iris species based on learned patterns.

## Files Included
- `ROSHINI_K__TASK_1_DATASCIENCE_OASIS.ipynb` – Colab notebook  
- `Iris.csv` – Dataset used  
- Demonstration video uploaded on YouTube

---

## Note
This project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship (OIBSIP). The code was written in Google Colab and the demo was recorded and uploaded for review.
